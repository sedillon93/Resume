**1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?**
<br />
> My interest in programming began after a friend designed a webpage for me. I had seen them develop many amazing projects, like games and intricate programs, during their computer science classes but had always thought that it would be too difficult for me to learn without a formal curriculum. However, when I asked how they had built the page, they said that it only used HTML and CSS, some of the best introductory languages for people interested in coding. They introduced me to Udacity as a stand in for formal classes I started the HTML and CSS course to see if I could create something of my own. Before I knew it I was crafting a webpage to hold and sort the multitude of recipes I collect from the internet. Fine tuning display details, experimenting with different layouts and styles, and watching my project grow were addicting. Coding taps into a creative spirit that I do not often get to let loose in my current role as an elementary school instructional assistant. I also love the fact that sometimes it is necessary to puzzle through problems and keep trying new methods until you hit the eureka moment. This was one of the aspects which drew me to my science degree, and I was thrilled to find that programming was an accessible way to rediscover that problem-solving passion. The opportunity to always keep learning engages me in a way few other pursuits can. I wanted to continue building my page and try new projects so I moved onto Udacity’s JavaScript lesson. This allowed me to make my page more dynamic and continue to improve user experience. Recently I have been following Ada’s Jumpstart program to learn the basics of Ruby and am excited to see what new possibilities open up as I continue to gain programming skills.

**2. If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years?**
<br />

> In five years I see myself working in a team at an innovative company with a broad-reaching goal, like improving green technology or services available to marginalized communities. I would have extensive experience in common front-end and back-end languages and would continue learning and exploring new technologies to keep myself relevant. I would always be looking for ways to improve myself as an engineer, such as learning up and coming languages and new skills using languages I already know. My love for the problem-solving and creative aspects of coding would keep me deeply involved in writing the programs needed for my team’s projects. Currently I am most interested in front-end web development, so this would likely be my specialty and I would be working on projects related to optimizing customer experience. However, I would make sure to study a variety of languages so that I could be a full-stack developer and understand how all of the different pieces fit together to make the whole project work. This would put me in a position to help my team members if they get stuck on a problem, and to be a mentor to new engineers, especially other women or minorities. One of the greatest resources to anyone trying to learn new skills is having someone who has more expertise than you who is happy to take time to talk and think through problems with you. I had several female geology professors in college; they coached, challenged, and inspired me. They emphasized that I could progress as far as I wanted in the field as long as I put in the time and effort. Providing similar support through my job and by volunteering with Ada would be an important piece of my role as a female software engineer.
