**1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?**
<br />
> My interest in programming began after a friend designed a webpage for me. I had seen them develop many amazing projects, like games and intricate programs, during their computer science classes but had always thought that it would be too difficult for me to learn without a formal curriculum. However, when I asked how they had built the page, they said that it only used HTML and CSS, some of the best introductory languages for people interested in coding. They introduced me to Udacity as a stand in for formal classes I started the HTML and CSS course to see if I could create something of my own. Before I knew it I was crafting a webpage to hold and sort the multitude of recipes I collect from the internet. Fine tuning display details, experimenting with different layouts and styles, and watching my project grow were addicting. Coding taps into a creative spirit that I do not often get to let loose in my current role as an elementary school instructional assistant. I also love the fact that sometimes it is necessary to puzzle through problems and keep trying new methods until you hit the eureka moment. This was one of the aspects which drew me to my science degree, and I was thrilled to find that programming was an accessible way to rediscover that problem-solving passion. The opportunity to always keep learning engages me in a way few other pursuits can. I wanted to continue building my page and try new projects so I moved onto Udacity’s JavaScript lesson. This allowed me to make my page more dynamic and continue to improve user experience. Recently I have been following Ada’s Jumpstart program to learn the basics of Ruby and am excited to see what new possibilities open up as I continue to gain programming skills.

**2. If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years?**
<br />

> In five years I see myself working in a team at an innovative company with a broad-reaching goal, like improving green technology or services available to marginalized communities. I would have extensive experience in common front-end and back-end languages and would continue learning and exploring new technologies to keep myself relevant. I would always be looking for ways to improve myself as an engineer, such as learning up and coming languages and new skills using languages I already know. My love for the problem-solving and creative aspects of coding would keep me deeply involved in writing the programs needed for my team’s projects. Currently I am most interested in front-end web development, so this would likely be my specialty and I would be working on projects related to optimizing customer experience. However, I would make sure to study a variety of languages so that I could be a full-stack developer and understand how all of the different pieces fit together to make the whole project work. This would put me in a position to help my team members if they get stuck on a problem, and to be a mentor to new engineers, especially other women or minorities. One of the greatest resources to anyone trying to learn new skills is having someone who has more expertise than you who is happy to take time to talk and think through problems with you. I had several female geology professors in college; they coached, challenged, and inspired me. They emphasized that I could progress as far as I wanted in the field as long as I put in the time and effort. Providing similar support through my job and by volunteering with Ada would be an important piece of my role as a female software engineer.

**3. After reading Ada's Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement, how will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community?**
<br />
> Working in education has emphasized the importance of doing my best to understand another person’s experiences and point of view and making sure everyone feels welcome. Part of what drew me to working with children is getting to be a part of shaping their worldview, and helping build a society which embraces differences as strengths instead of something to fear. One of the most rewarding aspects of this process is that I am always learning and broadening my own perspective as well. For example, this year I met a young student who I did not know identified as neither a boy or girl. After upsetting them by referring to them as a girl, I apologized and now make sure to use the pronouns that make them comfortable instead of gendered language. I believe always striving for inclusivity, and acknowledging mistakes, is essential so that every person knows they are valued for who they are. It is also important to make sure that every person knows they have a voice at the table. Unfortunately, this is not currently the case in many fields, including technology.
When I had the opportunity to hear Sheryl Sandberg speak at my university, she spoke firsthand about the challenges she faced as a woman in the technology industry. She shared how in meetings she was commonly grossly outnumbered by men, and how the few women present would inadvertently find themselves physically on the outskirts of groups during discussion. As a woman pursuing a science major, I could relate to her experiences of feeling out of place or like she had to prove she belonged. I also understood the importance of women supporting each other as we worked to earn a place in our chosen fields. After reading through the materials on social justice and inclusivity available through Ada’s jumpstart program, I am eager to become a part of this community. By supporting women and minorities, and helping each other along the programming journey, the Ada Community is helping women pursue their love of coding and gain valuable work skills while simultaneously advancing the tech industry. If I am accepted into the Ada cohort, I will consciously work with the other Adies to build a welcoming space for all participants regardless of how we identify. Together we could create a space based on appreciation of what each person contributes to the community, where open dialogue and differences are celebrated, setting the stage for ingenuity and new frontiers in tech. Creativity and innovation are foundational to the technology industry, and the best way to fuel these are by having a team of people with diverse mindsets and perspectives.

**4. Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?**
<br />
> One of the mistakes that I have learned the most from was how I approached my college Calculus II class. When I took the class first semester freshman year, I knew that I was not prepared because I had struggled with concepts in Calculus I during high school. I was afraid to admit that and feel that I was not as smart as my peers, so I enrolled in Calculus II despite my misgivings. Throughout the course I seldom attended office hours, would refrain from asking questions when I was confused, prioritized coursework from my easier classes, told myself that Calculus was too difficult for me, and got anxious when I did not understand a concept. At the end of the course I had barely passed. In junior year I decided that retaking the class was worth a shot. From day one of the course, I completed every assignment ahead of schedule and regularly dropped by the professor’s office hours, especially before exams. We would discuss any problems I was stuck on, and I would persist until I genuinely understood his explanations. In the evening I would go through unassigned problems to reinforce what I had learned. Most importantly, refrains of “how can I solve this” and “I can do this if I take my time” replaced my earlier, negative self-talk. I finished the class with an A-. This experience taught me the importance of having the courage to admit I do not know something, trying different strategies, seeking out people who know more than you do, maintaining a positive mindset, and persevering. Now whenever I set a goal I keep my thinking positive and change tactics when I get stuck. Most importantly I use every resource available, especially people who are more experienced than I am.
