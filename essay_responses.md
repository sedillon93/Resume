**1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?**
<br />
> My interest in programming began after a friend designed a webpage for me. I had seen them develop many amazing projects, like games and intricate programs, during their computer science classes but had always thought that it would be too difficult for me to learn without a formal curriculum. However, when I asked how they had built the page, they said that it only used HTML and CSS, some of the best introductory languages for people interested in coding. They introduced me to Udacity as a stand in for formal classes I started the HTML and CSS course to see if I could create something of my own. Before I knew it I was crafting a webpage to hold and sort the multitude of recipes I collect from the internet. Fine tuning display details, experimenting with different layouts and styles, and watching my project grow were addicting. Coding taps into a creative spirit that I do not often get to let loose in my current role as an elementary school instructional assistant. I also love the fact that sometimes it is necessary to puzzle through problems and keep trying new methods until you hit the eureka moment. This was one of the aspects which drew me to my science degree, and I was thrilled to find that programming was an accessible way to rediscover that problem-solving passion. The opportunity to always keep learning engages me in a way few other pursuits can. I wanted to continue building my page and try new projects so I moved onto Udacity’s JavaScript lesson. This allowed me to make my page more dynamic and continue to improve user experience. Recently I have been following Ada’s Jumpstart program to learn the basics of Ruby and am excited to see what new possibilities open up as I continue to gain programming skills.
